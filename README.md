- Optimized PLEASE FUNKYRA DON'T FORGET ABOUT THIS

## Components:

- Minecraft Coder Pack

### About Cross-compat Between Forge and Cleanroom

- Cleanroom mods (Fugue, Scalar) will be ignored by Forge, so then won't crash Forge
- Jar of Cleanroom integrated mods (MixinBooter, ConfigAnyTime) will be ignored by Cleanroom, then won't crash under Cleanroom
- The version of built-in MixinBooter is configurable in forge_early.cfg

### List of Obsoleted/Incompatible Mods ?? is it actually ??

- SpongeForge: Use [SpongeForge LTS](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/spongeforge)

- Forgelin: Use [Forgelin-Continuous](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/forgelin-continuous)
- LibrarianLib: Use [LibrarianLib-Continuous](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/librarianlib-continuous)

## Build Instructions:

1. Clone this repository
2. `git submodule init` then `git submodule update` ???
3. Import the `build.gradle` into your IDE (most preferably IntelliJ IDEA)
4. Once the import has finished, run `gradlew setup`
5. Run `gradlew --stop` to stop the daemon and prevent ForgeGradle gone wrong
6. Build with `gradlew build`

## Development Tips:

- Only modify `projects/catroom/src/` directory if you want to change vanilla
- Run `gradlew genPatches` before commit, or the changes won't exist
- Modifications on `src/` doesn't need generating patches
- [Tips from Forge](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/wiki/If-you-want-to-contribute-to-Forge) are still apply, keep the patches clean!
- The current patches is full of useless hunks after we switched to VineFlower, we encourage contributors to clean up these patches manually.

## Mod Development:

Official template is here: [template](https://github.com/CleanroomMC/CleanroomModTemplate)
